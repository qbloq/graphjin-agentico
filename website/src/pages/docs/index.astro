  <h1>Introduction to GraphJin</h1>
  
  <p>
    GraphJin is a compiler that converts GraphQL into optimized SQL. It's designed to be the bridge between AI agents and your database, enabling secure, hallucination-free data access through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  </p>

  <h2>Why GraphJin?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>AI Native:</strong> Built for MCP. Agents can discover your schema and write valid queries instantly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Zero Config:</strong> Auto-discovers tables, relationships, and foreign keys.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High Performance:</strong> No N+1 queries. No resolvers. Just blazing fast SQL.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  
  <p>To get started with GraphJin, you can run it as a standalone service or embed it in your Go/Node.js application.</p>
